# 🎬 Amazon Prime Content Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Amazon Prime Video’s catalog of TV shows and movies. Using Python and Pandas, we uncover patterns in content types, genres, age ratings, IMDb scores, and release trends to generate actionable business insights.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Amazon Prime offers a wide variety of content, but it’s unclear whether the content strategy aligns with viewer preferences and quality expectations. This project aims to analyze the dataset to uncover:
- Which content types and genres perform best
- What kind of audiences are being targeted
- Whether current content output matches audience satisfaction

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

To help Amazon Prime:
- Improve content quality and user engagement
- Identify underrepresented genres or age groups
- Align future content strategy with audience trends
- Use data insights to inform production, acquisition, and marketing decisions
