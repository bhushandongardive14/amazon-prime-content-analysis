    "The task of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Amazon Prime TV shows and movies dataset. The dataset consists of two primary files: titles.csv, which presents extensive information about the content on Amazon Prime (e.g., title, type, genres, release year, runtime, and IMDb score), and credits.csv, which presents the cast and crew of each title.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of the project is to learn about content trends on the Amazon Prime platform. By examining the category of content (TV series vs. films), spread across genres, time-series changes, and audience ratings (IMDb ratings), we can observe trends that can assist content creators, producers, or platform curators in making data-driven choices. Moreover, we examine the possibility of using machine learning methods to forecast IMDb ratings on the basis of existing features such as genre, length, and release year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process starts with data loading and initial data cleaning. Missing values, null values, and data type inconsistencies are detected and managed. For example, the release_year column, which is first read as an object, is coerced to a numeric or datetime type for temporal analysis purposes. Missing title values or other critical fields in rows are removed to ensure data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the EDA section also delves into several different facets of the content. We examine the proportion between TV series and films, the most frequent genres, and the trends in release years. One of the prominent observations is the growing number of content being created and uploaded to the platform in the recent past, showing Amazon's increased spending on original content and acquisitions. Plots like bar plots and line plots easily convey these trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also examine genre popularity and see that genres such as comedy, drama, and thriller are the most commonly listed on the site. We analyze the distribution of IMDb scores to gauge the quality of content and user opinion. We find that there are top-performing genres and determine if the type of content or length of the content relates to the IMDb score.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then move to a machine learning approach in the latter half of the project. We try to train a regression model to forecast the IMDb ratings of titles based on available features. Categorical features like genres are converted using one-hot encoding, and numerical features like runtime are utilized as is. We employ a basic linear regression model for the first experiment and measure the performance in terms of R¬≤ score on the test set. This provides us with a baseline idea of how accurately such models could predict content ratings, although additional tuning and feature engineering would be necessary to refine accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "All graphs produced throughout the EDA are stored as PNG files and embedded into a PowerPoint presentation. The presentation condenses the main findings, visual trends, and model insights, ensuring that the analysis is an easy one to share with stakeholders or colleagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this project illustrates how data on structured content from streaming services such as Amazon Prime can be utilized in order to provide actionable insights and form the basis for predictive models. The analysis offers useful insights regarding genre distribution, content strategy over periods of time, and audience reception. Areas for future enhancement can include sentiment analysis from reviews, influence of popularity among casts, or time-series forecasts of content trends.\n",
